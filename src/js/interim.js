/**
 * The following theme has transitional properties to
 * mitigate the upgrade to the design-system theme.
 * Using the interim theme will help you avoid critical
 * and immediate breaking changes.
 *
 * How does it work?
 * Copy the content of the interimTheme file to your local theme file
 * and update your official HPE theme to point to the new HPE
 * design-system theme (via your package.json).
 * Copying the content of this file will help you avoid immediate
 * breaking changes behavior.
 * However the main goal is for your theme to work independently without
 * the interim file support.
